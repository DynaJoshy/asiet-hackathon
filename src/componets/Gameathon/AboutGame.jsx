            Each team must have a minimum of 4 members, and participants must bring their own laptops or systems to develop the application. TILTLABS' technical and creative team will also be available on-premise to assist with any doubts or questions. The final games will be evaluated by TILTLABS' Creative Officer and Lead Game Designer.
            Around 20 teams will be allocated for participation on a first-come, first-served basis. For those who are new to game development, TILTLABS' will also be conducting a 40-hour Bootcamp before the Gameathon to help participants understand the basics of game development using Unity and complete their game ideas into an app.
            On successful completion of the Gameathon, prizes, gifts, scholarships to the TILTEDU education program, and internships at TILTLABS will be awarded to the top-performing teams. Additionally, participants will have the opportunity to work with TILTLABS' new gaming, virtual production, and esports studio, which will be launching on the ASIET campus.
